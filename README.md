# TABE25M

THIS ATOM PLUGIN WILL FORCE YOU TO __TAKE A BREAK EVERY 25 MINUTES.__ EACH BREAK LASTS 5 MINUTES. INSPIRED BY THE POMODORO TECHNIQUE.
I CREATED THIS PLUGIN BECAUSE I FOUND MYSELF CODING NONSTOP FOR HOURS.
THIS IS NOT A HEALTHY HABIT AND IT HURTS MY EYES, JUST LIKE A WALL OF ALL CAPITALIZED TEXT YOU ARE READING HERE.

## USAGE

### TYPING IN ATOM WILL SET A 25 MINUTES TIMER

### AS THE BREAK TIME APPROACHES, A REMINDER WILL APPEAR.

### THE REMINDER INTENSIFIES AS THE BREAK APPROACHES

### THEN IT COMPLETELY FILLS YOUR SCREEN, FORCING YOU TO TAKE A BREAK

### ALL ATOM WINDOWS ARE LOCKED AT THE SAME TIME, SO YOU CANNOT SWITCH TO ANOTHER WINDOW DURING THE BREAK.

## TAKING A BREAK INSTANTLY

YOU CAN INSTANTIATE A BREAK BY RUNNING THE “IMA DESHO” COMMAND. THIS WILL PUT YOU INTO A 5-MINUTE BREAK AND RESETS THE TIMER.


## CUSTOMIZATION

THERE IS NO CUSTOMIZATION. THE NAME TABE25M STANDS FOR __TAKE A BREAK EVERY 25 MINUTES,__ SO IT’S 25 MINUTES.

HOWEVER, THERE IS A FORK OF THIS PACKAGE THAT HAS CUSTOMIZATION, YOU CAN [CHECK IT OUT](https://atom.io/packages/take-a-break)!
